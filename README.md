# WebBrowserCompability
The automation framework has been designed to ensure cross-browser compatibility and is validated on both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

Key Highlights

Built reusable automation scripts for login, navigation, and conditional UI handling.

Implemented WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions to improve test stability.

Designed the framework to gracefully handle optional elements (e.g., skipping steps if a button is not present).

Added logging and exception handling for better debugging and traceability.

Enabled cross-browser execution on Chrome and Firefox to ensure consistent user experience.

This repository demonstrates strong skills in UI automation, cross-browser testing, and test framework design, making it adaptable for real-world QA automation needs.

TestCase01 – Login Flow Validation

This test case covers the following scenarios:

1. Successful Login – Valid credentials allow the user to log in.
2. Message Verification – Captures and validates the greeting message: "Hello, Debangana (username)".
3. Failure Handling – If the XPath for the name field is incorrect, the test fails and automatically captures a screenshot for debugging.
